	<div class='p'>Howdy y'all. Pete Rimshnick here, hailing from the small but not too southern town of Sandyston, NJ. I guess you could say we have our share of rednecks, but the views are nice and the air is fresh, so it's a swell place. I went to Kittatinny Regional High School (a hardy walk of 16 miles from 'Sandyrock'), which is more known for its homegrown wrestlers than anything else. Anyways, I lied; At the moment I'm not really hailing from Sandyston, but rather from sunny Ithaca with all its gorgeous gorges or something. Here at Cornell I am in the College of Engineering and plan to major in Operations Research, as I hear they are the engineers that have the most fun, get hired first, fired last, and make the most money. Plus, even if that isn't true it at least sounds cool. Right now I am looking forward to having a great time at Acacia with my twin brother Dave and the cordial brothers of this, the best of all fraternities. In my spare time I enjoy playing golf, tennis, watching West Wing and eating Oreos. But that's just me.</div>

	<div class='p'>Hey, I'm Mike. I'm from Syracuse, NY, so Cornell is not too huge a change in scenery. I'm a pre-med bio major (either biochem or genetics) in Ag and Life Sciences. In my spare time I'm interested in a lot of things. I was a swimmer and cross country runner throughout high school and I enjoy training and staying in shape whenever I can. At some point, I would like to compete in a triathlon. I also play the trumpet in the Cornell Pep Band. I have a wide range of musical tastes (jazz, classical, Beatles, rap, or pretty much anything) and especially enjoy jazz (like Miles Davis, Clifford Brown, Coltrane, and Charlie Parker). I look forward to being a brother at Acacia and hope that it will bring up many fond memories in the future.</div>

	<div class='p'>I thought I was a poor man because I had no shoes, but then I saw a man who had no feet.' The necessity of optimism conveyed by this quote communicates the essence of my, freshman David Rimshnick's, character. As a sophomore in the College of Engineering, I've offered up my knocks as boosts, boosts which hopefully will propel me in a career of Operations Research. I hail from the beautiful town of Sandyston, NJ, and thus am pleasured by the peaceful subtleties of the Ithaca landscape. My time is spread in all directions, but while I have some spare of it I enjoy reading, watching sports, playing golf, and watching West Wing reruns. Right now the focus of my life outside my academic pursuit is with Cornell Acacia, the pledging of which has been one of the most inspirational and unique experiences of my life. Acacia's values are my own, and thus I look forward to the strong ties of brotherhood and friendship due to grace my path down the icy streets of Cornell and enlighten my journey upon the road of life.</div>

My major is astrophysics (physics with a concentration in astronomy, for the pedants out there), and my job is my idea of relaxing fun--stellar bow shocks, accretion disks, and other phenomena of neutron stars in the ISM. I like piano, too--if you're ever in the basement of Lincoln hall and hear music coming from a room without the lights on, that's me I like pitch darkness. It's also one of the reasons I enjoy photography (other than the chemistry and the optics and the art of it). So I'm not exactly....normal. But hey, it happens.</div>

My home is now in Virginia Beach, VA, but my parents moved there at the same time I came to Cornell, so I never actually lived there. Before that, I was in Provo, UT, where I graduated from high school; before that Albany, NY; before that Syracuse, NY; before that St. Petersburg, Russia, where I was born. I suppose all this traveling around the country makes me All-American. As you can tell, writing is not my strong point, but I like art, technology, and the combination of two. I am glad I can take advantage of Cornell's large Greek system by being a part of Acacia. I will leave this place with many fond memories. Go Acacia!

I enjoy playing soccer and I am a member of Cornell's club volleyball team. I am also a Senator in the Hall Council. Over the summer I worked at an international camp in Quebec, Canada. So far, my Cornell experience has been one of exciting events and adjustment. I am looking forward to enhancing my time here with the addition of membership in Acacia. I am both excited and honored to be pledging to such a prestigious fraternity. I look forward to the new friends and memories that will be created and experienced with this brotherhood.</div>

Though I was involved in a substantial number of school and community activities in high school-from starting the school newspaper to Science Olymbiad to attempting a Guinness World Record as part of a charity event-I have kept my extracurricular activities here at Cornell thus far limited to the bowling and table tennis clubs.  Having dabbled in, among many others, the fields of robotics, numismatism, vintage Volkswagen restoration, and automobile ignition system-fired spud artillery, it's not likely I'm the most typical chap you've ever run accross.  In any case, I anticipate the next three years as a Cornellian and active Acacian to be an exciting and valuable time.</div>

For now I'm still undecided about what I'll do with my life, but when I figure it out, I plan on returning to the Midwest for a slower pace of life.  Most of my life has been split between work, sports and friends, and the same is true today.  I've moved from baesball, football, and soccer to bowling, golf, and tennis.  After school play dates and crushes turned into roommates and girlfriends, but it's all still the same to me.  My outlook on life is simple, and I hope it stays that way.  I think the world could afford to slow down a bit.  Some may disagree, but that's just who I am.</div>

While I'm not doing work, I enjoy the outdoors and have unsuccessfully tried to find time to explore the great outdoors of Ithaca.  I am also part of the Cornell Rugby team so you might see me practicing even if there is snow on the ground, because yes, rugby players are crazy.

However, I have absolutely no clue what I want to do with myself when I leave here, but I have time to worry about that.  I have lived in New York for my whole life, hailing from New City, in little Rockland County, north-west of the city and next to Westchester County (ah, there you go; now you have an idea of where it is).  As for fun, I enjoy a wide variety of things, though most of my time is spent just hanging out with friends.  More specifically however, I enjoy skiing and snowboarding, basketball, soccer, computer and video games, reading, drawing, and listening to music, even though I can't play an instrument for my life.  I have a very wide sense of humor and am a relatively easy-going guy.  On top of all this, I am a Disney junkie, and have been to Disney World more times than I can remember.  I look forward to my time here at Cornell and Acacia, and hope for the remainder to be as fun and rewarding as it has so far been.</div>

	<div class='p'>Hello, my name is Seth Jacobson. Originally from Rochester, Minnesota, I decided to come to Cornell to experience another part of the country and get the best education offered. Little did I know that I would start playing rugby and join a fraternity. Both decisions are leading me to great things. At school, I study Applied and Engineering Physics (AEP) with a very heavy interest in astronomy. Such projects as the Cassini space voyager or the Martian rovers inspire me, and I would love to be a part of future missions. But science isn't everything in my life; I enjoy reading and discussing everything from mythology to current events. Becoming a brother at Acacia has become an important part of my second semester and as a brother, in the future, I hope that I can help Acacia as much as it helps me achieve my goals.</div>

Unlike some here, I love Ithaca yearround - rain/snow or shine. Here at Cornell I study a lot of biology and chemistry as I hope to go to Veterinary School after graduation. In my free time I play the drums for the Big Red Marching Band, snowboard with the Cornell Ski Club, work at the Appel Service Center, and slack off playing poker with my friends. I've had a lot of fun pledging Acacia this year and look forward to becoming a full brother. Between the Red Hot pledge party, being dubbed 'Penguin,' and simply meeting the brothers at quiet dinners, I have found a place on campus I can call a home away from home. To summarize how I feel about Cornell Acacia, I can't wait to be able to quote the most poignant (and easy to remember) part of Acacia's preamble, "I am an Acacian. I am proud of it."</div>
