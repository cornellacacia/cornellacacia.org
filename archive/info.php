					<div class='title'>History of Cornell Acacia</div>
					<div class='p'>
						What are your letters?  Acacia is the only founding member of the National 
						Interfraternity Council to choose a full Greek word as its name rather than 
						a few letters. Our name, Acacia, comes from the Greek word AKAKIA which has 
						several different meanings. Acacia means &quot;distinctiveness and leadership 
						among men&quot;, &quot;brotherhood&quot;, and &quot;strength and ruggedness 
						of the spirit&quot;. 
					</div>
					<div class='p'>
						Acacia was founded in 1904 by 14 Master Masons at the University of Michigan. 
						Today it is a strong international fraternity, with Chapters at over 40 
						universities across the United States and one in Canada. Over 41,000 
						university men have called themselves Acacians, including prominent 
						figures such as Senators, university presidents, state governors, and 
						Nobel Laureates. Famous Acacia alumni include: President William Howard Taft,
						William Jennings Bryan, Cliff Hillegas (founder of Cliff's Notes), Wes Santee 
						(former Gold Medal distance runner), and Harold Edgerton (Nobel Prize in 
						Physics).  Read the <a href='http://www.news.cornell.edu/Chronicle/04/5.27.04/U.S.prez_visits.html'>article</a>
						from the Cornell Chronicle about Taft's visit to Cornell Acacia.
					</div>
					<div class='p'>
						The Cornell Chapter of Acacia was founded May 4, 1907 by the captain of the 
						football team and some of his friends. That same year our current house, 
						Northcote, was built. The chapter lived in a few houses before finally moving 
						into Northcote in 1934. Northcote was drafted by the same architect who 
						designed Baker Labs and various other buildings throughout Ithaca. Some 
						recognizable names of alumni around campus include George Jessup (Jessup 
						Fields), and Harold Riley and Byron Robb (Riley and Robb Hall). Several 
						current Cornell professors in such varied departments as Fine Arts, 
						Agriculture and Biological engineering, Communications, and the Johnson 
						School of Management are all Acacians from one of our many chapters.
					</div>
					<div class='p'>
						Over the years, the Cornell chapter has built a strong brotherhood on the 
						foundation of diversity and tradition. The Cornell chapter has initiated over 
						1000 brothers since we were founded on this campus. Our chapter has developed 
						a strong tradition, but we have avoided fostering a stereotype. We believe 
						that when a brother joins Acacia, he should not have to give up his 
						individuality. Instead, that brother will be able to enhance the 
						brotherhood with his own ideas. 
					</div>
					<div class='p'>
						Currently, we have 30 active brothers. Out fraternity is, therefore, able to 
						offer every member the chance to develop their own leadership abilities as 
						officers and as brothers. At Acacia, we have formed strong bonds of friendship
						which often cannot be found in some of the larger houses on this campus.
					</div>
					<div class='p'>
						Our house philosophy is to balance academics while having fun. Not only have 
						brothers achieved high academic honors, but our house GPA is well above the 
						university average. Perhaps the most appealing factor about a fraternity is 
						its social program. We have a full social calendar of parties, date nights, 
						mixers, and the annual &quot;Black and Gold&quot; Formal in which we take a dinner 
						cruise around Cayuga Lake.
					</div>
					<a name='int'></a>
					<div class='title'>An International Fraternity</div>
					<div class='p'>
						Acacia's strong international organization provides support for the local 
						chapter. With access to a database of alumni from Cornell (and the other 
						chapters) living everywhere in the world, actives and alumni can reach out 
						through a network of people who have shared a common experience in college. 
						Many Cornell Acacians stay at other chapters when they travel around the 
						country. Our organization also organizes both International Conclaves and 
						Leadership Academy on alternating years, giving actives the chance to meet
						and make friends with other actives from coast to coast. At the 2004 Conclave, 
						Cornell Chapter was recognized as an Outstanding Chapter of Acacia.
					</div>

					<div class='title'>Northcote, Our Home</div>
					<div class='p'>
						Since 1934, the Cornell Chapter of Acacia has resided in our house, 
						&quot;Northcote.&quot; Northcote is a large Chicago Prairie style home built 
						in 1907, which sits upon a large property along Highland Road on North Campus. 
						The luxury of wide lawns and open spaces gives us the ability to host large 
						outdoor events. Acacia is not owned by the university -- it is privately owned
						by our alumni, and this gives us greater financial independence and the 
						freedom to adapt the house to the needs of the active chapter. 
					</div>
					<div class='p'>
						The chapter takes pride in the condition of the house, and it is one of the 
						most impressive and well-maintained houses on campus. Bedrooms are all large 
						and comfortable, and the house offers many amenities such as computer 
						networking, DirectTV, a large recreation room with a pool table, and a small 
						gym. The house is a home, not a dormitory and as such we provide a modern open 
						kitchen with a cook for dinner and lunch, free laundry machines, and 
						comfortable areas to study and entertain friends and other guests. Our house
						sets the standard for fraternity living.  Moreover, it is <i>significantly</i> 
						cheaper than living in the dorms or in most off-campus apartments
					</div>

					<div class='title'>Academics</div>
					<div class='p'>
						The primary goal of every college student is to obtain the maximum from his 
						education. At Acacia, learning is one of our foremost objectives. We believe 
						that the fraternity needs to emphasize our main goal as university students. 
						The house provides a better place to work, study, or to meet up with members 
						for a team project. A brother can also depend on the upperclassmen in the 
						house for help with something that they have already experienced. 
						Most brothers' grades go up after joining the fraternity, and as a whole we 
						have a house GPA higher than the Cornell or Greek system averages. The 
						fraternity also provides a way of furthering your education outside of 
						lecture. Our Scholarship Chair brings in faculty for dinner discussions
						and for other educational purposes.
					</div>
					<a name='financial'></a>
					<div class='title'>Financial Support</div>
					<div class='p'>
						One of the ways that Acacia makes life at Cornell a little easier is by 
						lightening the financial load. Our chapter has an academic endowment of half 
						a million dollars, the largest per capita endowment on campus. This is divided 
						up into the Thompson Memorial scholarship which provides need based aid for 
						brothers on financial aid, and the Kuhn fund, which provides scholarships 
						for &quot;fraternity-ship.&quot; There are also several scholarships provided 
						by our National organization which Cornell Acacians have successfully earned
						recently
					</div>
					<a name='service'></a>
					<div class='title'>Human Service</div>
					<div class='p'>
						Acacia's motto is Greek for &quot;human service&quot;, which is our guide to 
						enjoyable and productive fraternity life. Every Acacian is well-served by his 
						membership. From social to scholarship opportunities, Acacia brothers do 
						service to themselves by expanding their horizons. In addition, brotherhood 
						in Acacia provides relationships that will enrich and serve your college 
						experience. Human service is also about reaching out to others. Part of 
						Acacia's purpose is to &quot;give light to those with whom we may be 
						associated as we travel along life's pathway.&quot; We do this by establishing 
						a strong presence in the community and participating in service projects. 
						Every one of these projects bring Acacians into contact with both the Cornell 
						and Ithaca communities and are fine philanthropic opportunities. Acacia 
						membership is an opportunity to grow by taking advantage of the opportunities 
						presented to brothers both within Acacia and in the community.
