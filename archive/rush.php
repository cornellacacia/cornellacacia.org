						Deciding which fraternity to rush will probably be the biggest decision of your college career. 
						The men of Acacia recommend that you go through the entire rush process with an open mind, 
						be yourself, and find where you fit in. At Acacia, we take pride in being one of the top 
						fraternities at Cornell and we believe strongly in five aspects of college life: academics, 
						brotherhood, social activity, campus/community involvement, and athletics.
					</div>
					
					<ul>
						<li>At Acacia, we understand the value of academics and try to facilitate a studious 
						environment at all times. Having one of the highest cumulative GPA's among the IFC, schoolwork 
						is placed above all other aspects of the fraternity.</li>
						<li>Brotherhood and the strong bond between our actives is what makes Acacia different from
						other fraternities. Trust, cooperation, and respect between every active creates a very
						comfortable environment to undertake any project or activity.</li>
						<li>The social scene at Acacia is extremely active. We try to have about 4-5 parties each 
						semester including a blowout party of enormous proportions. A formal dinner is also on 
						the events calendar each semester. Actives also find themselves among numerous movie 
						nights, sports nights, and countless other brotherhood events.</li>
						<li>Acacia's involvement in campus activities has earned it the Most Improved Chapter Award 
						in 2002. Along with participating in the &quot;7 Days of Service&quot; philanthropy, Acacia's motto of 
						&quot;Human Service&quot; promotes community involvement.</li>
						<li>We at Acacia participate in almost every sport; earning respect on the field among the 
						other fraternities. Soccer, volleyball, and basketball are just a few of the sports that we 
						are exceptionally well at.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<div class='p'>
						Since the founding of the American college fraternity movement in 1776, fraternities have 
						grown to symbolize leadership, independence, scholastic achievement and service to their 
						various campuses and communities.
					</div>
					
					<div class='p'>
						Fraternity men represent a very small percentage, only two percent, of the male population 
						in the United States.  However, that two percent is a very powerful group of individuals!  
						Fraternity men have gone on to hold many of the top positions in our nation, from the business 
						world to the political arena.
					</div>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Approximately 80 percent of the top executives of Fortune 500 companies are fraternity men.</li>
						<li>The majority (71 percent) of those listed in Who's Who in America are fraternity men.</li>
						<li>Seventy-six percent of current United States senators and congressmen are fraternity men.</li>
						<li>Forty percent of the 47 Supreme Court justices since 1910 have been fraternity men.</li>
						<li>One hundred of the 158 cabinet members since 1900 have been fraternity men.</li>
						<li>All but two United States Presidents since 1825 have been fraternity men.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<div class='p'>
						It is certainly no surprise that today's college and university students express a keen 
						interest in the Greek system. The opportunities are endless, and the benefits speak for
						themselves.  Each year, thousands of young men enter the working world with the competitive 
						advantage of fraternity experience and alumni contacts.
					</div>

						If you are an undergraduate male full-time student at Cornell and would like to learn more about 
						joining our fraternity, please look around this site to learn more us. Please don't hesitate to email us 
						if you're interested in the house, so we can get to know you better. Remember, the most successful and 
						happiest new members are those who know the brothers in the house the best!
